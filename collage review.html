        <section><h1 class="zero">College Infrastructure</h1>
            <p>Currently, the college is being run from a temporary building in the middle of the town. But I strongly believe that in four years of its establishment that campus could have been constructed and well started. I will look forward to the promise that will be fulfilled in the coming batches.</p>

        <section><h1 class="two">Academics</h1>
            <p>The teachers are very helpful and caring. They are always ready to help students. Most of the faculty members are either Ph.D. or are currently pursuing it. The course curriculum is very much relevant and whatever is been taught will definitely help the students in future.</p>

        <h2 class="one">Campus Life</h2>
        <p class="one">We had 3 buildings here one for management one for science with various labs and one for the juniors, there were various extra activities where we could take part and explore our interest, teachers here are very helpful and supportive. Talking about location it's very safe as the campus is centre of theat the city.I literally loved the location, every facilities were available in near by areas.</p>
